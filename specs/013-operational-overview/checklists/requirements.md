# Specification Quality Checklist: Operational Overview

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details beyond user-mandated interface/protocol constraints
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic except for explicit protocol/browser constraints
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional and non-functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No framework, source-file, or algorithm choice leaks into the specification

## Notes

- Canonical alert lifecycle, metrics/widgets, severity/acknowledgement/suppression, authorization, pagination, retention, and tenant/project scope are explicit review decisions in the specification.
- SSE, browser coverage, and public API compatibility are included because they are explicit UXF-004 requirements, not discretionary implementation choices.
