# Specification Quality Checklist: Persona Testing Blueprint

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning

**Created**: 2026-08-14

**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The implementation approach, including browser automation, visual comparison, agent prompts, fixture tooling, evidence storage, and CI integration, is intentionally deferred to planning.
- No clarification is required: the first delivery will focus on the defined P1 catalogue, safe fixtures, workflow runbooks, and evidence standards before expanding coverage.
